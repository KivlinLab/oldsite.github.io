# Clearing and staining roots
#### Protocol modified by Stephanie Kivlin 05.22.2018

(1) Place ~0.5-1.0 gm of roots/leaves in the bottom of a 15mL plastic centrifuge
vial with holes.

(2) Place the entire rack of vials in 10% KOH for 4 -5 days (darker, thicker roots
need to be cleared longer)

(3) Transfer to 1% HCl for 1 minute.

(4) Transfer to stain 0.01% acid fuschin in 14:1:1: lactic acid:glycerol:diH2O for
one day

(5) Transfer to destain 14:1:1: lactic acid:glycerol:diH2O for one day

(6) Samples can be stored in destain in 1.5mL centrifuge vials for at least one
year.


## Scoring Roots under the microscope

Microscopy – Magnified Intersection Method

1. Set up the microscope (ask for training if this is your first time!). Acid fuchsin is best viewed under fluorescence (excitation is 540λ, emission is 630 λ), but can also be viewed under a compound light microscope. For other stains (e.g., aniline blue, chlorazol black, ink), use light microscopy. Insert a cross-hair reticle in the eyepiece.

2. Mount roots in fresh destain on a microscope slide, with the roots laid out in the long direction of the slide and parallel to one another. Alternatively, roots can be mounted in advance using a semi-permanent to permanent mounting fluid (e.g., PVLG, Permount, ProLong, Flouro-gel).

3. Place your slide on the microscope and focus at 100X (10X objective + 10X eyepiece), then increase the magnification to 200X (20X objective + 10X eyepiece). Move your first field of view to the uppermost or lowermost root at either the far left or far right of the slide.

4. Move the stage up or down to move between roots. Systematically move the field of view to the left or right as you move across the slideIn each field of view, you will count the number of times that the vertical cross hair touches the following:

a. Aseptate hyphae
b. Arbuscules
c. Vesicles
d. Non-mycorrhizal fungal structures (septate hyphae, usually brown)

5. Once you reach the last root on the slide moving up or down, move the field of view a small distance to the left or right (depending on the edge of the slide where you started). Be sure to move over a minimum distance of one field of view. Continue the process of moving the slide up/down to score roots. Score a minimum of 100 fields of view per slide, being sure to record the number of total number of fields of view examined.

6. Quantification can be refined by adding more information. For example, hyphal width or position in root cortex, arbuscule shape and position, vesicle shape and wall thickness.

7. Roots can be replaced in their vial of destain (for storage) or discarded (if temporary). Slides can be wiped with ethanol and reused. Dispose of slides in the glass waste bin.

## Calculations
%RLChyphae = # of intersections with hyphae/ total number of intersections counted

%RLCseptate = # of intersections with saprophytic hyphae/ total number of intersections counted

%RLCarbuscules = # of intersections with arbuscules / total number of intersections counted 

%RLCvesicles = # of intersections with vesicles / total number of intersections counted
