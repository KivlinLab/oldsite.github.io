# Kivlin Lab – Ammonium Microplate Analysis

#### Updated 10.14.15 by Stephanie Kivlin

## Rationale
This assay uses a colorimetric change to quantify the amount of ammonium in your KCl extract, via the
inodphenol-blue or Berthelot method. Ammonium (NH 4 + ) reacts with hypochlorite (bleach) to form
monochloramine (NH2Cl). The monochloramine then reacts with salicylate to form benzoquinone
monoimine, which couples with salicylate to give the colored indophenol dye. The intensity of the color
represents the concentration of ammonium in the sample, which is determined on a microplate
spectrophotometer at λ = 667 nm (650 is optimal). Note that this assay is for nitrate and nitrite. If
substantial nitrite is expected to be present, it can be quantified alone for subtraction by performing this
assay without vanadium chloride. Note that there are slightly different protocols below for samples with
high or low ammonium content.

## Materials, Equipment, and Reagents

Acid-washed glassware for solutions

KCl (the same solution used for inorganic nitrogen extractions)

Citrate reagent (see below)

Sodium salicylate solution (make bi-weekly)

Bleach and sodium hypochlorite solution (make daily, see below)

Stock ammonium solution (100ppm)

Quality control standards (NSI simple nutrient inorganic QC solution, #QC-138)

Microplates, 96-well clear polystyrene with lids (e.g., Fisher #08-772-7, #08-772-2B)

Multichannel pipette, pipetting basins, and pipette tips

Microfuge tubes (1.5ml)

## Solutions

### Salicylate nitroprusside solution

Combine the following and bring to 100 ml with DI water:

6.8 g sodium salicylate (Fisher # S395-500)

5.0 g sodium citrate (Fisher # BP327-1)

5.0 g sodium tartrate (Fisher # BP352-500)

0.025 g sodium nitroprusside (Fisher # S350-100)

### Bleach and sodium hypochlorite solution

Add the following and bring to 100 ml with DI water:

6.0 g sodium hydroxide (Fisher #S318-1)

2 ml of concentrated bleach

### Ammonium stock solution

Stock: 100 ppm ammonium stock solution: add 0.23585 g ammonium sulfate (Fisher # A938-
500) to 500 ml ultrafiltered DI water.

### Ammonium standard curve solutions

Make small amounts of fresh standards regularly in 1.5 ml tubes. Dilute the 100 ppm stock to
10ppm in a 1.5 ml centrifuge (150ul stock and 1350 ul KCl or other extraction matrix). Then
create the following standard curves from the 10ppm stock via serial dilution (note that the
LOW concentration standards use the 1ppm solution you make in the HIGH standards).

xxxx | HIGH | xxxx | xxxx | LOW | xxxx
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ----
Concentration | μl 10 ppm | μl matrix | Concentration | μl 1 ppm | μl matrix
0ppm | 0 | 1000 | 0ppm | 0 | 1000
0.5 | 50 | 950 | 0.05 | 50 | 950
1.0 | 100 | 900 | 0.10 | 100 | 900
2.0 | 200 | 800 | 0.20 | 200 | 800
5.0 | 500 | 500 | 0.50 | 500 | 500
10.0 | 1000 | 0 | 1.00 | 1000 | 0


## Methods

Sample-Reagent Mixtures

1. For samples in the range of 5-10ppm N, add the following to each well:

20 ul sample

90 ul salicylate solution

90 ul bleach solution

2. For samples in the range of &lt;1-5 ppm N, add the following to each well.

40 ul sample

80 ul salicylate solution

80 ul bleach solution


## Microplate Loading

1. Load samples into the microplate - there are 2 replicates per sample.

2. Load 2 rows of the NH4 standards so that there are 2 replicate for each standard.

3. Load 2 replicates of the quality controls.

4. Load 2 replicates of field blanks (if not using the same batch of KCl).

5. Add the reagents (using multichannel pipettes) to all wells and be sure to pipette up and down
to mix well.

6. Remember to record what samples go into each well. A sample table is copied below.

7. Place cover on the microplate and wrap in tin foil.

8. Let stand for 50 min at room temperature to ensure that the reaction is complete.

### Color Development

The samples will turn a blue green color at room temperature in &lt; 1 hr. However, if the
concentration of ammonium is too high, the reaction will go too far and the sample will turn
yellow. If this happens the sample should be diluted and run again. (e.g., common dilution: 100
μl sample + 900 μl matrix). For dilutions, remember to run a control (a sample that did not need
to be diluted) with the diluted samples.

## Using the Multimode Detector Plate Reader

1. Measure absorbance using the spectrophotometer at 650nm.

## Calculations

1. To convert the absorbance value provided by the plate reader to a concentration (ppm) in the
sample, use your standards to create a standard curve. That is, plot the known ppm of the
standards (X) against the absorbance values reported (Y). Fit a linear regression to the data
(Y=mX + b).

2. Use the equation of the regression line in the standard curve to convert your sample absorbance
values into concentrations (X = (Y-b)/m).

3. Adjust sample concentrations by the average ppm of the field blanks.

4. Check that your quality control values are within an acceptable range.

5. Convert to ug nitrate per g of soil (recalling that ppm is ug/ml). Multiply the ug/ml nitrate from
the microplate assay by the ml of extractant (KCl) solution and divide by g dry soil.
