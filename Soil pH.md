# Kivlin Lab - Soil pH Protocol
#### Last updated by Stephanie Kivlin 05.22.2018

## Overview
The pH of soil is a measure of hydrogen ion activity in soil solution, which is a primary controller
of soil nutrient availability. A common method of measuring soil pH is performed by placing a
glass electrode in a mixture of soil and deionized water (DI H 2 O). The most common ratio used
is 1:1 soil to water, but a ratio of 1:2 soil to DI H 2 O is also used to improve the fluidity of the
slurry. Increased volume of solute is particularly useful for soils with high organic matter and
clay concentrations that can absorb a large volume of water. Electrolyte solutions, such as 0.01
M CaCl 2 , can be added to soil rather than DI H 2 O (referred to as salt pH). The use of electrolyte
solutions helps to minimize variable soil-water pH due to differences in background salt levels
and also improves electrical conductivity. The conventional pH scale is 0 to 14 at 25°C. The pH
reading will depend on the soil to solution ratio, electrolyte concentration, and spatial
placement of the electrode, among other factors.

When measuring pH in a new soil, you may want to test the soil to water ratio and other
conditions to optimize the protocol below. The typical amount of soil used is 10-20 g (or ml if by
volume).

## Materials and Equipment

Buffer solutions with pH 4.00, 5.00, 7.00 (others may be used, see calibration protocol below)

Deionized (DI) water

pH meter with glass electrode

Sample cups and lids

Graduated cylinder (25 ml) or repipettor

Analytical balance (to 0.1g)

Orbital shaker

Magnetic stirrer and stir bars

Squirt bottle

Waste cups

Lint-free cloth

## Procedure

1. Add 10 g soil and 20 ml DI H 2 O to a 125 ml cup (or use more soil or water depending on
the soil conductivity). For heavier soils (i.e., sandy soils), use 15 or 20 g soil and the
appropriate amount of water for a 1:2 solution. Cap.

2. Place cups on orbital shaker and shake at 150 rpm for 30 min.

3. Remove cups from shaker, remove caps, and allow to stand at room temperature (20-
25°C) for 20 min to equilibrate to atmospheric CO2.

4. Calibrate pH meter with pH 4, 5, and 7 buffers (see protocol below).

5. Place electrode in slurry. Measurement may be taken with (sandy soils) or without
(loamy to clayey soils) continuous stirring (see Note 1 below). If measurement is made
without continuous stirring, gently swirl the sample while reading is being taken.

6. Allow adequate time for pH to reach a stable reading (typically 20 to 90 sec). When the
sensor output has stabilized, the display freezes automatically and √A appears. Record
pH to the nearest 0.01.

7. If electrode needs to be set aside between samples, rinse electrode with DI H2O and
store in 4M KCl cap (DO NOT store in water). Otherwise, rinse in DI H2O and move
directly to next sample.

8. Check calibration every 10 to 15 samples using the pH buffer nearest to that of the soil
sample pH. Recalibrate if reading is not within 0.05 units of buffer value.

9. When finished, use squirt bottle to rinse with DI water into waste cup until no soil or
residue remains on the electrode.

10. Put cap back on electrode filled with 4M KCl. Make sure cap is filled with 4M KCl. If not,
immediately fill cap. Wipe away any excess KCl that overflows when electrode is placed in cap.

11. Turn OFF.

## Calibration of pH meter

The electrode must be calibrated at a minimum of two points that bracket the expected pH of
the samples and are approximately three pH units or more apart.

1. Ensure room temperature is between 20 and 25°C before proceeding with calibration.

2. Turn pH meter ON.

3. Remove electrode cap.

4. Make sure the pH meter is clean. If not, rinse off any KCL precipitate with DI H2O and
blot with damp, lint-free cloth if needed (do NOT rub or wipe and do NOT use a kimwipe
or paper towel – these will scratch the glass and will also cause static buildup!).

5. Check 4M KCL filling solution in the electrode. If low, re-fill with filling solution by
opening filling hole plug and adding electrolyte to just below the refill hole. Leave a
small amount of space below the refill hole to help minimize electrolyte leakage and
build-up of KCl crystallization at the filling hole. Replace the plug.

6. Buffers are automatically recognized during calibration. To define your own buffer
group, follow the buffer setting procedure (see manual). For 2 or 3-point calibration:
Place electrode in pH buffer, press ‘Cal,’ and swirl cup gently until the pH meter
automatically endpoints (typically 20 to 90 sec). If necessary, press ‘Read’ to manually
endpoint. Rinse with DI H 2 O and repeat procedure with each calibration buffer.

#### Notes

1. Differences in pH will occur based on how much the soil has settled in slurry. To avoid
this problem, stir the soil slurry right before measurement. With sandy soils, the settling
time of soil particles is rapid and continuous stirring during measurement is
recommended. Note that these differences are more pronounced with soil pH in water
compared to electrolyte solutions.

2. Glass electrodes have a short life span when measuring pH of sandy soils. The sand
particles are abrasive to the glass resulting in electrode breakage or malfunction. When
electrodes fail to measure pH of calibration buffers or quality control samples show
more error than expected, replace electrodes.

3. pH measurements can be made to the nearest 0.1 or 0.01 pH unit. Accuracy beyond this
level is not possible. If measurements are made to the nearest 0.01 unit, pH should be
rounded to 0.1 pH units before reporting.

4. Potential measurement errors can arise from samples with very low (&lt;1) or very high
(&gt;10) pH; special electrodes may be required. Errors can also occur if there are
temperature differences between standards and soil samples. Particularly be sure to
control sample temperature at 25 ± 1°C when sample pH approaches the alkaline end of
the scale (e. g. , a pH of 11 or above).

5. Report the following when publishing pH data from this method:

Soil slurry dilution (1:1 or 1:2)

Water extracted (as opposed to 0.01 CaCl 2 or 1 M KCl solution)

Air dried, field fresh, or frozen soil

pH units to 0.1
