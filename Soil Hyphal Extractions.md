# Kivlin Lab – Soil Hyphal Extractions
## Rationale
This protocol uses stirring and detergent to disaggregate soil in order to extract fungal hyphae from soil particles. The solution is filtered through a 0.45-um membrane to remove the hyphae from the liquid. The hyphae are stained for visualization and counted using the grid-intercept method. By using a known amount of soil and known grid size, we can calculate the length of hyphae per gram of soil.

### Materials, Equipment, Reagents
Destain, 14:1:1 lactic acid: glycerol: water
Stain, 0.01% acid fuchsin in destain
Sodium hexametaphosphate solution, 35.7 g in 1 L water
Aluminum oven tins, pre-weighed
Vacuum filtration assembly (fritted glass support, 15ml-graduated funnel, clamp, no. 5
stopper, filter flask with side arm, vacuum tubing, tubing connectors) Beakers, glass 500ml and 200ml (tall and narrow if available)
Mounting media (destain for temporary, PVLG for semi-permanent) Microscope slides, 75x25x1 mm with one end frosted
Coverglasses, 60x24mm or 50x22mm
Magnetic stirrer and stir bars
Plastic pastuer pipettes
Filter membranes, 25-mm diameter, 0.45-um pore size Forceps with flat tips
Syringes, plastic 5-ml
Clear nail polish
Eyepiece reticule with grid (1cm2 divided into 10x10 squares)

### Method
1. Set up the vacuum filtration assembly and attach to the vacuum, placing a trap (another vacuum flask) in the line between the filtration and the vacuum in case of overflow.
2. Add 5-10 g fresh wt soil to a beaker (run preliminary tests to decide on the amount of soil for your ecosystem). Record the soil weight. Place a second soil sample (~5-10 g) into a pre-weighed tin for measuring gravimetric soil moisture, record weight of tin + wet soil, dry to constant weight, then reweigh tin + dry soil.
3. Add 450 ml water and 50 ml sodium hexametaphosphate solution.
4. Stir at full speed for 5 min.
5. Reduce to 40% speed and quickly pour off 200 ml into a new beaker. At this stage, you can also dilute your solution as needed if the hyphae are too dense. Be sure to record your dilution factor. For sandy soils, dilution is not usually needed. For clay soils, our dilution typically ranges from 1:4 to 1:9.
6. Stir again at full speed for 2 min. While this is stirring, wet a 0.45um filter membrane (handle only with forceps) and place on the vacuum filtration assembly.
7. Reduce to 40% speed and use the syringe to take a 5-ml sample from the center of the funnel at about 1-cm depth.
8. Filter through the 0.45-um membrane with vacuum on. Once entirely through, remove the funnel and apply ~5 drops of acid fuchsin stain with vacuum on.
9. Turn vacuum off and move filter to a pre-labeled slide. Allow to air dry while you process other samples (typically 4-8). Once dry, trim as necessary to fit under coverslip.
10. When dry, mount in destain (temporary) or in PVLG (semi-permanent) under a coverslip, two filters per slide. Place the mounting solution carefully on the filter papers, avoiding using too much or too little. When adding the coverslip, move slowly from one end to the other to avoid air bubbles.
11. Allow mounted slides to dry overnight as appropriate for the mounting medium. Seal the edges with clear nail polish, allow to dry, and store in a slide box.
12. Be sure to rinse all glassware in between samples (preferably dip in soapy water and rinse in distilled water). Do NOT pour the remaining soil solution in the sink – it will clog the drain. Pour into a large container or bucket and allow soil to settle to the bottom (this can take several days). Once settled, pour off the clear water and dispose of the soil appropriately (i.e., autoclave then trash).
13. When finished, clean the fritted glass support with destain (vacuum through).

### Microscopy – Gridline Intercept Method
1. Set up the microscope. Acid fuchsin is best viewed under fluorescence (excitation is 540λ, emission is 630λ), but can also be viewed under a compound light microscope. For light microscopy, trypan blue, aniline blue, or other stains are usually preferable. Be sure to insert the grid reticule (grid of 10x10 squares) in the eyepiece.
2. Place your slide on the microscope and focus at 200X.
3. Score the number of intersections between a grid line and a hypha in each field of view,
omitting the top and right-hand gridlines (to avoid double counting in the final calculations). Record both the number of intersections and the number of fields of view assessed. Score a minimum of 50 fields of view per filter. Move the field of view either systematically or at pre-chosen random points to avoid bias in the selection of fields of view to score.


### Calculations
Hyphal length (H) is calculated from the length of hyphae observed per sample (L), the total area examined per slide (A), the catchment area of the filter (C), and the soil sample size (S), and the dilution factor (if the sample was diluted during extraction).

L = (sum of all counts per filter) x (11/14) x (size of a small grid square in mm at 200x)

A = (sum of all squares counted/100) x (the size of one side of the 10x10 grid in mm at 200x)2 C = π x (filter radius in mm)2

S = g dry mass soil added to the extraction

H (mm hyphae per filter) = (L x C / A)

Calculate H for each filter, then sum the two filters to get mm/slide.

Then convert to mm hyphae per g dry soil:
H (mm hyphae per g dry soil) = (L x C/A) x (initial solution volume in ml/ sample volume in ml)/ S
Where S (in grams) is calculated as:
S = wet soil sample weight – (wet soil sample weight * Ѳ)

Gravimetric soil moisture (Ѳ) is calculated as follows, with all weights in grams:

Ѳ = [(weight of wet soil + tin) – (weight of dry soil + tin)] / [(weight of dry soil + tin) – tin weight]

If a dilution was used, be sure to incorporate the dilution factor into the final calculation of sample volume.
Note that for our microscope, the magnification is 200x (10x eyepiece, 20x objective). At 200x on the microscope, one full side of the grid square is 0.505mm and the size of of side of a small grid square is 0.0505mm. These numbers change between microscopes, so always check with a stage micrometer.
