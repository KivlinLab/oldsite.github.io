# Kivlin Lab – Nitrate(+Nitrite) Microplate Analysis

#### Updated Stephanie Kivlin 05.22.2018

## Rationale

This assay uses a colorimetric change to quantify the amount of nitrate in your KCl extract. Vanadium(III)
in an acid solution is used to reduce nitrate to nitrite. The nitrite is captured by Griess reagents resulting
in a detectable colorimetric change (chormophores are formed from the diazotization of sulfanilamide
by acidic nitrite followed by coupling with NEDD). The intensity of the color represents the
concentration of nitrate+nitrite in the sample, which is determined on a microplate spectrophotometer 
at λ = 540 nm. The current protocol is optimized for low (&lt; 1 ppm) and high (&gt; 1 ppm) concentrations of
nitrate. Note that this assay is for nitrate and nitrite. If substantial nitrite is expected to be present, it
can be quantified alone for subtraction by performing this assay without vanadium chloride.

## Materials, Equipment, and Reagents

Acid-washed glassware for solutions

KCl (the same solution used for inorganic nitrogen extractions)

Vanadium (III) chloride (VCl3)

Sulfanilamide

N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDD)

1M HCl

KNO3

Quality control standards (NSI simple nutrient inorganic QC solution, cat no QC-138)

Microplates, 96-well clear polystyrene with lids

Multichannel pipette and pipetting basins

Microfuge tubes

## Solutions

Vanadium chloride solutions

Vanadium chloride solutions should be made in an anaerobic chamber (filled with N2 or He) to prevent
reaction with air. Pour small amounts of the solution into tubes, wrap in aluminum foil and freeze. The
volume in the tubes should represent ‘single-use’ (typically one or two microplates worth) because
opening the tube more than once substantially degrades the solution. In the freezer, the vanadium
chloride solution should last for ~1 year. The VCl3 solution should be a blue color (it will be lighter for
the diluted solution). If it starts turning more purple/pink then it has reacted with air and won’t be
effective. 

Note: This solution replaces step 1 below.

### Concentrated VCl3 - used for Low Protocol :
1. Add 80 mg VCl3 to 10 ml 1M HCl

2. Gently shake to dissolve (should only take a few minutes)

3. Add 40 mg of sulfanilamide and 2 mg N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDD) to 20 ml HCl (0.5-1M)

4. Add the VCl 3 HCl solution to the HCl, NEDD, sulfanilamide solution

5. If there are undissolved solids, use a syringe filter to remove them

## Diluted VCl 3 - used for High Protocol:

1. Add 80 mg VCl 3 to 10 ml 1M HCl

2. Gently shake to dissolve (should only take a few minutes)

3. Add 40mg of sulfanilamide and 2 mg N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDD) to
80 ml DI water

4. Add the VCl 3 HCl solution to the water solution

5. If there are undissolved solids, use a syringe filter to remove them

## Nitrate standard solutions

Make fresh standards.

100 ppm nitrate stock solution: add 0.3609 g potassium nitrate to 500 ml ultrafiltered DI water.
For high standards, make 2 ml of a 10 ppm stock solution:

Add 200 µl of 100 ppm stock solution &amp; 1800 µl of matrix 2M KCl solution to a 1.5 ml microfuge
tube. Use the 10 ppm stock to make the remaining high standards:

xxx | µl of 10ppm stock | µl of 2M KCl Matrix
--- | ----------------- | -------------------
0.0ppm | 0 | 1000
2.0ppm | 200 | 800
5.0ppm | 500 | 500
10.0ppm | 1000 | 0

For low standards, make 2 ml of a 1 ppm stock solution:

Add 20 µl of 100 ppm stock solution &amp; 1980 µl of matrix 2M KCl solution to a 1.5 ml microfuge
tube. Use the 1 ppm stock to make the remaining low standards:

xxx | µl of 1ppm stock | µl of 2M KCl Matrix
--- | ---------------- | -------------------
0.0ppm | 0  | 1000
0.05ppm | 50 | 950
0.1ppm | 100 | 900
0.2ppm | 200 | 800
0.5ppm | 500 | 500
1.0ppm | 1000 | 0


## Methods

Sample to Reagent Ratios (recommended by Doane & Howarth 2003)

Concentration of NO3- N in Sample (ppm) | Ratio of Sample to Reagent (VCl 3 ) | Example volumes for Sample and Reagent (µl) | Protocol
--------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------
<1 | 5:4 | 500:400 | Low
1-5 | 1:10 | 100:1000 | High
1-10 | 9:200 | 45:1000 | High
1-20* | 1:50 | 20:1000 | High

*Note: we have not tested the protocol for this concentration NO3 .

## Microplate Loading
1. Load plate with two rows of the NO3 standards so that there are two replicates per standard

2. Load samples into the microplate - there are two replicates per sample

3. Load two replicates of the quality controls

4. Remember to record what samples go into each well. Below is a sample data sheet.

## Low Protocol

1. For our low nitrogen soil samples we have been using a 5:4 of sample to reagent (85 µl sample:
68 µl of concentrated VCl3 ). Be sure to optimize for your samples.

2. Add 85 µl of each of the low NO3 standards (0ppm, 0.05ppm, 0.1ppm, 0.2ppm, 0.5ppm, 1ppm)
in rows 1 and 2.

3. Add 85 µl of each sample into the microplate wells twice so that there are 2 replicates.

4. Add 85 µl of the LOW quality control (1.004ppm) twice so that there are 2 replicates.

5. Add 68 µl of VCl3 into each cell containing low NO 3 standards and samples.

## High Protocol

1. For our soil samples with a NO3 -N range of 1-5 ppm, we have been using a 1:10 ratio of sample
to reagent (14 µl sample: 140 µl of diluted VCl3 ). Optimize for your samples.

2. Add 14 µl of each of the high NO3 standards (0ppm, 2ppm, 5ppm, 10ppm) in rows 1 and 2.

3. Add 14 µl of each sample into the microplate wells twice so that there are 2 replicates.

4. Add 14 µl of the HIGH quality control (5.0ppm) twice so that there are 2 replicates.

5. Add 140 µl of VCl 3 into each cell containing low NO3 standards and samples.

## Color Development

Color development at room temperature (20-25°C) slows down after 4-5 hr and is maximized after
14-16 hr. Absorbance declines ~5% from maximum after 48 hr. Once color development slows, the
exact time of measurement is typically not important, but should be recorded. For convenience,
prepare samples near the end of one day and read the absorbance the following day.
If time is limited, the speed of color development can be increased by warming the samples to 60°C.
We have not tested this method.

## Using the Multimode Detector Plate Reader (ICMB Core Facility)

1. Place microplate cover on the plate and wrap in aluminum foil (VCl3 is light sensitive).

2. Gently tap sides of the microplate to mix the samples and reagent.

3. Let stand overnight to ensure that the reaction is complete.

4. Measure absorbance the next morning using the spectrophotometer.

5. Measure the absorbance at 540 nm (on the ICMB spec, use the “ABS@540” protocol).

## Calculations

1. To convert the absorbance value provided by the plate reader to a concentration (ppm) in the
sample, use your standards to create a standard curve. That is, plot the known ppm of the
standards (X) against the absorbance values reported (Y). Fit a linear regression to the data
(Y=mX + b).

2. Use the equation of the regression line in the standard curve to convert your sample absorbance
values into concentrations X = (Y-b)/m).

3. Adjust sample concentrations by the average ppm of the field blanks.

4. Check that your quality control values are within an acceptable range.

5. To convert to µg NO 3 g -1 of soil, first, note that ppm is the same as µg ml -1 . Multiply µg ml -1 NO3
from the microplate assay by the ml of extractant (KCl) solution and divide by g dry soil.
