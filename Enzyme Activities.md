# Fluorimetric and Oxidative Enzyme Assay Protocol for Soils: CBH, BG, AG, NAG, BX, and AP

(Modified from Saiya-Cork, K. R., R. L. Sinsabaugh, and D. R. Zak. 2002. The effects of long term nitrogen deposition on extracellular enzyme activity in an Acer saccharum forest soil. Soil Biology & Biochemistry 34:1309-1315.)

## Reagents:

1.0 M NaOH

4 g NaOH pellets

100 mL DI water

50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 (can make a 10X stock solution; pH can vary with soil)

4.374 g sodium acetate trihydrate
1.1 ml glacial acetic acid (add more to make pH = 5)
1 L sterile DI water (miliQ water)

## Substrate solutions
Enzyme | Substrate |
------ | --------- |
Cellobiohydrolase (CBH)	| 4-MUB-β-D-cellobioside (in refrigerator) (12.5 mg/50 mL 500 µM)
β-Glucosidase (BG)	| 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside (16.9 mg/50 mL 1000 µM)
Alpha-Glucosidase (AG)	| 4-Methylumbelliferyl Alpha-D-glucopyranoside (16.9 mg/50 mL 1000 µM)
N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)	| 4-Methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide (38 mg/50 mL 2000 µM)
β-xylosidase (BX)	| 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-D-xylopyranoside (15.4 mg/50 mL 1000 µM)
Acid phosphatase (AP)	| 4-Methylumbelliferyl Phosphate (51.2 mg/50 mL 4000 µM)
MUB standard	| 4-Methylumbelliferone (0.89 mg/50 ml 100 µM)


Make substrate and fluorescent standard solutions in 125 mL red glass bottles using milliQ water. Store solutions in the 4°C refrigerator. Substrates are in freezer unless noted. Remake solutions every week, and make them one day BEFORE you want to start working, as this affects the measured activity levels. MUB standard should be diluted to 25 µM before use, depending on expected sample fluorescence.  MUB is made by heating the solution to 90°C for a few minutes, with constant stirring (don’t let it boil).

Two additional enzymes, β-xylosidase (BX), and acid phosphatase (AP) can be assayed on a separate plate.  BX requires the substrate 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-D-xylopyranoside, which is made at the concentration of 1000 µM (15.4 mg/50 mL), and AP requires the substrate 4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate, which is made at a concentration of 4000 µM (51.2 mg/50 mL).  If the BX, AP plate is run at the same time as the CBH, BG, AG, and NAG plate, then an additional MUB standard is not necessary.

Label black plates with sample names.  For example, Microcosm 1 (0.01% starch)

## Sample Preparation: Soils
If the dry weight of the sample is unknown, obtain fresh soil or litter samples and split each into two parts.

Weigh one part, record mass, place in tared coin envelope or soil tin and dry at 105°C to constant weight (24 hours).  Record dry mass.

Weigh other part (1-2 g wet weight), record mass, and place in labeled 500 ml container. Add 125 ml acetate buffer and blend on highest speed for 1 minute to make a homogenate slurry. If the dry weight of the sample is already known, it can be added directly to the 500 ml container.

Rinse blender with DI water between samples.

## Sample Preparation: Microcosms
Obtain microcosm (fresh or frozen).  Add 30 mL of sodium acetate buffer, swirl, and pour into 500 mL container.  Add another 30 mL to microcosm, swirl, and pour into same 500 mL container.  Make sure there is no sand left in microcosm (swirl well!).

## Assay Set-up
All assay plates should be arranged as follows:

Using the multi-channel pipette with wide-mouth tips (i.e., trimmed with scissors), add the homogenate to all wells receiving homogenate:

All wells should now contain 250 µl.  Place plates in incubator at proper temperature for soils (e.g., 10°C for Alaskan soils).  Incubate for one hour.

## Assay Termination

After one hour of incubation, add 10 µL of 1 M NaOH to each well, noting time. Note: this is not done in advance. Add the NaOH to the plates and wait 10 min, then read the plates.  This is important.  Give the NaOH time to interact with the MUB.  MUB will only fluoresce in alkaline conditions.  

## Reading Plates

Read fluorescence plates at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission. 

## Standard Curve Construction

It is important to calculate the standard curve for the MUB based on the MUB standard wells (wells 9-10).  First, obtain the “homogenate blank” value by averaging the values in column 11.  Then, take the MUB standard values, average them for each MUB concentration, and subtract the homogenate blank from the fluorescence values for each concentration.  Construct a standard curve using linear regression (MUB concentration on the x-axis, and Fluorescence on the y-axis) to obtain the slope.  Make sure this is calculated with the MUB concentrations in mols/L (which is synonymous with nmols/mL).  The slope is your Extinction Coeeficient (E).  To calculate the “quench”, simply construct a second standard curve (in a separate plate) that receives buffer and no homogenate.  This “unquenched” curve gives the true fluorescence of MUB.  The ratio of the slope of the standard curve containing soils to the standard curve containing buffer tells you how much the soil quenches the fluorescence of the MUB.  





## Fluorescence Activity

Activity (nmol h-1 g-1) = {NFU / (E/0.250 mL)}/ (1 hour X (1/DF) X 0.200 mL) 

NFU = net fluorescence units = Assay Fluorescence – Homogenate Blank – Substrate Blank*quench conversion

Quench conversion = slope of MUB standard with soil/slope of MUB standard with buffer
E = extinction coefficient
Assay volume = 0.250 mL
Homogenate volume = 0.200 mL
Dilution factor = Volume buffer (mL)/ mass of soil or microcosm (g)
For soils, the mass of the soil used in the dilution factor should be the dry mass for final enzymatic activity values.
