(Bartlett, R.J. and D.S. Ross. 1988. Colorimetric determination of oxidizable carbon in acid soil solutions. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 52:1191-1192)

## Rationale
This assay uses a colorimetric change to quantify the amount of oxidizable organic matter in acid soil
extracts by measuring the loss of color of an Mn(III)-pyrophosphate complex. Using K 2 SO 4 extracts, it is
possible to use the method to estimate microbial biomass C. The loss of color is determined on a
microplate spectrophotometer at an absorbance of λ = 495 nm. The protocol is applicable to solutions
containing 0.08 to 4 mM of organic C. Most microbial biomass samples will be over 4 mM C and must be
diluted.

## Materials and Reagents

Na4P2O7 (sodium pyrophosphate, anhydrous)
H2SO4 (sulfuric acid)
KMnO4 (potassium permanganate)
MnSO4 · H2O (manganese sulfate monohydrate)
Oxalic acid dihydrate

##Solutions
Make all solutions in volumetric flasks

Mn(III)-pyrophosphate solution
-Create a 0.1M Na 4 P 2 O 7 solution by dissolving 2.659 g Na 4 P 2 O 7 in 100mL nanopure water.
-Create a 0.1M KMnO 4 solution by dissolving 0.790 g KMnO 4 in 50mL nanopure water.
-Create a 0.1M MnSO 4 · H 2 O solution by dissolving 0.845 g MnSO 4 in 50mL nanopure water.
- Measure out 20mL of 0.1M MnSO 4 and set aside.
-Add about 100mL nanopure water in a 250-mL volumetric flask.
-Add and mix:
75mL of 0.1M Na4P2O7
5mL of 0.1M KMnO4
318 µL of concentrated H2SO4
-Immediately add the 20mL of 0.1M MnSO4 solution and bring to volume with nanopure water. Mix.
-Cover bottle with foil.
The colored solution is 10mM Mn(III)-pyrophosphate. It is the color of blood oranges. It will remain
useable for several weeks if kept in the fridge in a bottle covered with foil (it is light-sensitive). This is
enough to run 50 plates (1200 samples).

Oxalic acid standard solutions
Make fresh standards.
200mM oxalic acid-C stock solution: add 1.261 g oxalic acid dihydrate to 100 mL nanopure water.
Create a diluted 4mM-C solution: put 2mL of the 200 mM stock solution in 98mL nanopure water.

## ORGANIC CARBON MICROPLATE ANALYSIS

Create the following standards:

Standard | mM | mL oxalic acid diluted stock (10mM) to add | mL of nanopure water
-------- | -- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------
1 | 4 | 30 mL of diluted stock | 0 ml
2 | 3 | 15 mL of diluted stock | 5 mL
3 | 2 | 10 mL of diluted stock | 10 mL
4 | 1 | 10 mL of diluted stock | 30 mL
5 | 0.5 | 10 mL of #4 | 10 mL
6 | 0.25 | 10 mL of #4 | 30 mL
7 | 0.1 | 10 mL of #6 | 15 mL
8 | 0 | 0 | 20 mL

## Sample dilution
Fumigated samples need to be diluted because they are often over 4mM C. Unfumigated samples
can be run without dilution.
1. Use two 96-deep well plates and a 200 µl l multi-channel pipette.
2. Load the first plate with 200µl of water in each sample well (Columns 2-11).
3. Then load 200µl of each sample into their respective wells. Mix by pipetting up and down. This is
a 1:1 dilution (dilution factor = 2).
4. Load the second plate with 400ul of water in each sample well (Columns 2-11).
5. Take 100µl of sample from the first plate and pipette into the second plate. Mix by pipetting up
and down. This is a 1:4 dilution from the 1:1 plate for a total dilution of 1:9 (dilution factor = 10).
6. You should now have three plates, one with undiluted samples, one with a 2x dilution and one
with a 10x dilution.

## Microplate Loading
1. Use clear 96-well plates.
2. Load plate with two replicates of each oxalic acid standard.
3. Load three replicates per samples into the microplate. IMPORTANT: Cl - ions interfere with the
method, so make sure not to use samples extracted with KCl (e.g. Nmin samples). K 2 SO 4 extracts
(e.g. microbial biomass) work fine.
4. To make calculations easier using the template, make sure that all samples within a microplate
will be corrected using the same value for blanks.

Load plate according to the example below:

xxx | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
--- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- | -- | -- |
A | Std1 | S1 | S9 | S17 | S25 | S33 | S41 | S49 | S57 | S65 | S73 | Std1 |
B | Std2 | S2 | S10 | S18 | S26 | S34 | S42 | S50 | S58 | S66 | S74 | Std2 |

## ORGANIC CARBON MICROPLATE ANALYSIS

1. In a clear plate, add 100 µL of each of the oxalic acid standards in rows 1 and 2.
2. Add 100 µL of each sample into the microplate wells in three replicate plates so that there are 3
replicates. Make sure to shake or pipette up and down the microbial biomass sample before
pipetting so it is well mixed.
3. Add 50 µL of Mn(III)-pyrophosphate solution to each well.
4. Add 50 µL of concentrated H 2 SO 4 to each well and mix by pipetting up and down 10x.
5. Place microplate cover on the plate and wrap in aluminum foil (light sensitive).
6. Let stand overnight (18h) at room temperature to ensure that the reaction is complete.
7. Measure absorbance the next morning (495nm).
A 96-well plate requires 4.8mL of Mn(III)-pyrophosphate.

### Calculations
1. To convert the absorbance value provided by the plate reader to a concentration (mM) in the
sample, use your standards to create a standard curve. That is, plot the known mM of the
standards (X) against the absorbance values reported (Y). Fit a linear regression to the data
(Y=mX + b).
2. Use the equation of the regression line in the standard curve to convert your sample absorbance
values into concentrations.
3. Adjust sample concentrations by the average mM of the field blanks.
4. Adjust sample concentrations by their dilution factor.
5. To convert to mg C g -1 of soil, multiply mM-C from the microplate assay by the volume of
extractant solution (K 2 SO 4 ) in liters, multiply by 12mgC/mmolC, and divide by g dry soil.
6. A calculation template can be found in the file TOC_microplate_calculation_template.xlsx
