# Qubit Protocol DNA

Use the HS (high sensitivity) dsDNA kit

Dilute the qubit dye 1:200 in buffer. I.e. 1ul dye to 199ul buffer

Samples are run with 2ul of DNA (either PCR product or DNA extract) and 198ul of buffer mix

Standards are run with 10ul of standard (0ng/ul or 10ng/ul) and 190ul of buffer mix

Read on plate reader at 485 excition-530 nm emission/fluorescence on black 96-well plates

# Qubit Protocol RNA

Dilute the qubit dye 1:200 in buffer. I.e. 1ul dye to 199ul buffer

Samples are run with 2ul of DNA (either PCR product or DNA extract) and 198ul of buffer mix

Standards are run with 10ul of standard (0ng/ul or 10ng/ul) and 190ul of buffer mix
